This mod randomizes at the start of the game (when the game is loaded) all the normal rounds (1 to 140). Can cause a bit of lag

Bloons can upgrade one tier (20%), become camo/regrow/fortified (30% and stack) or do nothing (0.01%).
Bloons will be randomized within their stack. If a Red Bloon is randomized to a Blue, it doesn't mean all Red will become Blue.

If a BAD upgrades there is a 0.01% chance of it turning into a Test Bloon. The rest of the time, it will turn into a random boss.
