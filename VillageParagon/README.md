# *Monkey Industry enters the ring!*
Here is the new Village paragon. 

- Name: Monkey Industry
- Description: "Throws specialized Bots on the field. Tier 5s sacrifices enchance the paragon's tower of the same type but will consume everything that isn't a village. Also gives mega buffs."
- Cost: 650k
- Range: 87
- Sentry placement rate = 10 - 5 * degree / 100 * (How many T5s sacrificed (capped at 5 for each type)) / 20


### How does it work ?
The Monkey Industry is a mix of Sun Temple, Engineer Monkey and Monkey Village. As its description says, the paragon throws "specialized Bots" on the field. More info on each sentry [here](https://github.com/WarperSan/BTD6-Mods/blob/main/VillageParagon/Sentries/README.md). **The paragon uses the same "AI" as the 4xx Engineer for its Bots' placement.** Look on the [Wiki page of the Sentry Expert](https://bloons.fandom.com/wiki/Sentry_Expert#Types_of_Sentries) to see when each sentry is used.

The only Village aspect of the Village paragon (irony) is its buffs:
- A 30% discount on EVERY upgrade of every tower in range
- 50% more range for every tower in range
- Makes towers in range 170% shoot faster
