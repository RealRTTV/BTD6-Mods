# *Monkey Industry enters the ring!*
Here is the new Village paragon. 

Name : Monkey Industry

Description : "Throws specialized Bots on the field. Tier 5s sacrifices enchance the paragon's tower of the same type but will consume everything that isn't a village. Also gives mega buffs."

### How does it work ?
The Monkey Industry is a mix of Sun Temple, Engineer Monkey and Monkey Village. As its description says, the paragon throws "specialized Bots" on the field. More info on each sentry [here](https://github.com/WarperSan/BTD6-Mods/blob/main/VillageParagon/Sentries/README.md)
