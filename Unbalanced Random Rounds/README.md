This mod randomizes at the start of the game (when the game is loaded) all the normal rounds (1 to 139). Can cause a bit of lag.

Bloons become a random bloon (includes every bloon in the game (bosses included) except the golden bloon), can become camo/regrow/fortified (30% and stack) or do nothing (0.01%). 
Bloons will be randomized within their stack. If a Red Bloon is randomized to a Blue, it doesn't mean all Red will become Blue.
