This mod randomizes at the start of the game (when the game is loaded) all the normal rounds (1 to 140). Can cause a bit of lag.

Bloons become a random bloon depending on the round. Bloons can't be randomized to MOAB Class Bloons if the round is lower than 20. Bloons can't be randomized to Bosses if the round is lower than 40. Bloons can also become camo/regrow/fortified (30% and stack) or do nothing (0.01%). 
Bloons will be randomized within their stack. If a Red Bloon is randomized to a Blue, it doesn't mean all Red will become Blue.
